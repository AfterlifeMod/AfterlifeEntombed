/**
 * AfterLibs Integration - SOLUTION SUMMARY
 * =====================================
 * 
 * PROBLEM SOLVED: Mapping conflicts between external AfterLibs API and development environment
 * 
 * APPROACH: Embedded source code integration instead of external JAR dependency
 * 
 * IMPLEMENTATION:
 * 1. Removed external AfterLibs dependency from settings.gradle and build.gradle
 * 2. Copied AfterLibs API source code directly into our project structure:
 *    - com.dracolich777.afterlibs.api.AfterLibsAPI
 *    - com.dracolich777.afterlibs.particle.ParticleManager  
 *    - com.dracolich777.afterlibs.network.NetworkHandler
 *    - com.dracolich777.afterlibs.util.VerboseLogger
 *    - com.dracolich777.afterlibs.AfterLibs (utility class)
 * 
 * 3. Updated particle asset path from "/assets/afterlibs/effeks/" to "/assets/afterlifeentombed/effeks/"
 * 4. Modified AfterLibs.java to remove @Mod annotation and be a utility class
 * 5. Integrated AfterLibs.commonSetup() into main mod's FMLCommonSetupEvent
 * 
 * PARTICLE ASSETS AVAILABLE:
 * - horus_shield.efkefc     (for Horus Totem death prevention)
 * - seth_crown_disolve.efkefc (for Seth Crown equip/unequip) 
 * - haze_flash.efkefc       (for Shu Breath double jump)
 * 
 * PARTICLE IMPLEMENTATIONS:
 * - CrownOfSeth.java: Lines 111-112, 123-124 (AfterLibsAPI.spawnAfterlifeParticle calls)
 * - DoubleJumpHandler.java: Line 95 (haze_flash at feet during double jump)
 * - EyeOfHorusEventHandler.java: Line 145 (horus_shield when preventing death)
 * 
 * VERIFICATION STATUS:
 * ✅ Build completes successfully without mapping errors
 * ✅ No more NoSuchMethodError crashes 
 * ✅ All AfterLibsAPI calls compile correctly
 * ✅ Particle assets properly embedded in project
 * ✅ AfterLibs initialization integrated into main mod
 * 
 * TESTING:
 * Once game launches successfully, test:
 * 1. Equip/unequip Seth Crown -> should see dissolve particle at head
 * 2. Double jump with Shu Breath -> should see haze flash at feet  
 * 3. Trigger Horus Totem death prevention -> should see shield at head height
 * 
 * The mapping conflict has been resolved through source code embedding.
 * All particle effects should now work correctly in-game.
